[ANIMATION_STRATEGY]
1. **Pedagogical Animation Plan:** 
    - **Parent VGroup transitions (if applicable):**
        - **No VGroups are used in this scene** as the focus is on individual elements transitioning smoothly to illustrate the instantaneous rate of change without the need for grouping.
        
    - **Element animations within VGroups and for individual Mobjects:**
        - **Animation Sequence**:
            - **Create the function graph**:
                - Animation Type: `Create`
                - Target Object: `function`
                - `run_time`: 2 seconds
                - **Pedagogical Purpose**: Starting with the function graph visually establishes a baseline for understanding slopes, grounding viewers in the context of the derivative.
                
            - **Create the Dot**:
                - Animation Type: `Create`
                - Target Object: `dot`
                - `run_time`: 1 second
                - **Pedagogical Purpose**: Highlighting the point of tangency emphasizes the significance of this specific point in understanding instantaneous rates of change.
                
            - **Create the Tangent Line**:
                - Animation Type: `Create`
                - Target Object: `tangent_line`
                - `run_time`: 1.5 seconds
                - **Pedagogical Purpose**: The introduction of the tangent line visually represents how we can find the instantaneous slope at that point, making the abstract concept tangible.
                
            - **Write the Derivative Notation**:
                - Animation Type: `Write`
                - Target Object: `derivative_tex`
                - `run_time`: 1 second
                - **Pedagogical Purpose**: Displaying the derivative notation alongside the tangent line connects the visual representation to the mathematical concept, reinforcing understanding.

            - **Display Explanation Text**:
                - Animation Type: `Write`
                - Target Object: `explanation_tex`
                - `run_time`: 1 second
                - **Pedagogical Purpose**: This text summarizes the concept of instantaneous rate of change, aiding in conceptual reinforcement and ensuring the key idea is clear.

    - **Coordinate element animations**:
        - Each animation builds upon the previous one, ensuring that the viewer’s attention transitions smoothly from the graph to the point of tangency, and finally to the tangent line and derivative notation. This sequence emphasizes the relationship between the visual elements and the mathematical concepts they represent.

2. **Scene Flow - Pedagogical Pacing and Clarity:** 
    - **Overall animation sequence**:
        - Start with the function graph, then introduce the dot at the tangential point, followed by the tangent line, and conclude with the derivative notation and explanation text. This progression logically reveals the connection between the average slope and the instantaneous slope, reinforcing understanding step by step.
        
    - **Transition buffers for pedagogical pauses**:
        - After creating the function graph, use `Wait(1)` to allow viewers to absorb the context.
        - After introducing the dot, use `Wait(1)` to emphasize its importance before moving to the tangent line.
        - After the tangent line appears, use `Wait(1)` for viewers to visualize its significance before introducing the derivative notation.
        - Finally, use `Wait(2)` after displaying the explanation text to ensure viewers have time to process the key concept before the scene ends.

    - **Coordinate animation timing with narration for engagement and comprehension**:
        - Ensure that each animation cue aligns with the corresponding part of the narration. For example, when discussing the tangent line, that animation should occur simultaneously with the narration explaining its significance as the instantaneous slope.

[NARRATION]
- **Pedagogical Narration Script:**
    - "Building on what we saw in the previous part, let’s explore the concept of instantaneous rate of change. [Create function graph, Wait(1)] Imagine you’re driving a car. As you travel, your speed at any given moment can change, just like the slope of a curve. To understand how fast you’re going at a specific moment, we need to look at the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point. [Create dot, Wait(1)]
    
    - Here, we have a function, let’s say \( y = x^2 \). At \( x = 1 \), we can visualize this with a dot. This dot represents the point of tangency where we want to find the instantaneous slope. [Create tangent line, Wait(1)]
    
    - Now, when we draw a tangent line at this point, we can see how this line just touches the curve without crossing it. This tangent line gives us the instantaneous slope of the function at that exact point. This is crucial because it tells us how the function behaves at that specific moment, rather than over an interval. [Write derivative notation, Wait(1)]
    
    - We denote this instantaneous rate of change as \( f'(x) \), which is the derivative of the function. [Write explanation text, Wait(2)] In summary, the derivative captures how a function changes at a precise point, helping us understand the dynamics of the function in a way that average slopes cannot."

- **Narration Sync - Pedagogical Alignment:**
    - Each segment of narration is precisely aligned with the animations, creating a cohesive learning experience. For example, when the function graph is created, the narration introduces the concept of instantaneous rate of change. This coordination enhances comprehension and keeps viewers engaged, as they can see the visual representation of what is being explained.
