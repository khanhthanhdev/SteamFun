0. **Dependencies**:
    - **Manim API Version**: Latest stable version (e.g., 0.15.0).
    - **Allowed Imports**: `from manim import *`, `import numpy as np`.

1. **Manim Object Selection & Configuration (Text and Shapes)**:
    - **Axes**: 
        - `axes = Axes(x_range=[0, 4, 1], y_range=[0, 5, 1], axis_config={"color": BLUE})`
    - **Points (Dots)**:
        - `point_a = Dot(axes.c2p(1, function(1)), color=RED)` 
        - `point_b = Dot(axes.c2p(3, function(3)), color=RED)`
    - **Connecting Line**:
        - `connecting_line = Line(point_a.get_center(), point_b.get_center(), color=YELLOW)`
    - **Rise and Run Annotations**:
        - `rise = MathTex(r"\text{Rise} = f(3) - f(1)").scale(0.7)`
        - `run = MathTex(r"\text{Run} = 3 - 1").scale(0.7)`
    - **Final Slope Annotation**:
        - `slope = MathTex(r"\text{Slope} = \frac{\text{Rise}}{\text{Run}}").scale(0.7)`

    - **Text Considerations**:
        - All `MathTex` objects will be used for mathematical expressions. The font size for annotations will be set to 24.
        - Confirm all objects begin within the safe area (0.5 units from all edges) and maintain at least 0.3 units spacing to avoid overlaps.

2. **VGroup Structure & Hierarchy**:
    - Group annotations for clarity:
        - `rise_run_group = VGroup(rise, run)` will hold both rise and run annotations.
        - `slope_group = VGroup(slope)` will hold the final slope annotation.
    - Ensure internal spacing of at least 0.3 units within each group.

3. **Spatial Positioning Strategy**:
    - **Axes**: Centered using the default positioning at ORIGIN.
    - **Point A**:
        - Positioned relative to the axes: `point_a.next_to(axes, UP, buff=0.5)`
    - **Point B**:
        - Positioned relative to the axes: `point_b.next_to(point_a, RIGHT, buff=0.5)`
    - **Connecting Line**: 
        - Created as a direct connection between the centers of `point_a` and `point_b`.
    - **Rise Annotation**: 
        - Positioned above the connecting line: `rise.next_to(connecting_line, UP, buff=0.3)`
    - **Run Annotation**: 
        - Positioned below the rise annotation: `run.next_to(rise, DOWN, buff=0.3)`
    - **Slope Annotation**: 
        - Positioned at the top of the scene, aligned with the center: `slope.to_edge(UP, buff=0.5)`

4. **Animation Methods & Object Lifecycle Management**:
    - Animation Sequence:
        - `self.play(Create(axes), run_time=2)`
        - `self.wait(1)`
        - `self.play(Create(point_a), run_time=1)`
        - `self.wait(0.5)`
        - `self.play(Create(point_b), run_time=1)`
        - `self.wait(0.5)`
        - `self.play(Create(connecting_line), run_time=1)`
        - `self.wait(1)`
        - `self.play(Write(rise), run_time=1)`
        - `self.play(Write(run), run_time=1)`
        - `self.wait(1)`
        - `self.play(Write(slope), run_time=1)`
        - `self.wait(2)`

5. **Code Structure & Reusability**:
    - Organize the overall code structure into logical sections: dependencies, object definitions, layout stages, and the main `construct` method.
    - Include inline comments to document the rationale for configuration choices. For example:
        ```python
        # Create axes to represent the function graph
        axes = Axes(...)
        ```

***Mandatory Safety Checks***:
    - **Safe Area Enforcement**: All objects, including text bounding boxes, must remain within 0.5 unit margins.
    - **Minimum Spacing Validation**: Confirm a minimum of 0.3 units spacing between every pair of objects.
    - **Transition Buffers**: Use explicit `Wait()` calls to separate animation steps and sub-scenes.
