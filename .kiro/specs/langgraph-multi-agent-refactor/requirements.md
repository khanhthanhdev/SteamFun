# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing video generation system from a sequential pipeline (planner → code_generator → video_renderer) into a collaborative multi-agent system using LangGraph. The current system processes video generation tasks in a linear fashion, but a multi-agent approach will enable better parallelization, fault tolerance, error recovery, and more sophisticated coordination between different specialized agents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the video generation system to use LangGraph for agent orchestration, so that I can benefit from better error handling, state management, and agent coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL create a LangGraph workflow with defined agent nodes
2. WHEN an agent encounters an error THEN the system SHALL route to appropriate error handling agents
3. WHEN agents need to communicate THEN they SHALL use LangGraph's state management system
4. IF an agent fails THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery through alternative paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want specialized agents for different tasks, so that each agent can focus on its specific domain expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize a PlannerAgent for video planning tasks
2. WHEN planning is complete THEN it SHALL initialize a CodeGeneratorAgent for Manim code generation
3. WHEN code generation is complete THEN it SHALL initialize a RendererAgent for video rendering
4. WHEN visual errors are detected THEN it SHALL initialize a VisualAnalysisAgent for error correction
5. WHEN RAG queries are needed THEN it SHALL initialize a RAGAgent for context retrieval

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain the same external API, so that existing integrations continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external code calls the video generation API THEN it SHALL receive the same response format
2. WHEN the system processes a video generation request THEN it SHALL produce the same output structure
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be reported in the same format as the current system
4. IF configuration parameters are provided THEN they SHALL be honored in the same way

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and recovery, so that the system is more robust and can self-correct issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code generation error occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically route to error correction agents
2. WHEN visual analysis detects issues THEN it SHALL trigger code refinement workflows
3. WHEN rendering fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative rendering strategies
4. IF multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL track and resolve them systematically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want better observability and monitoring, so that I can understand system behavior and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents execute tasks THEN the system SHALL log agent transitions and state changes
2. WHEN workflows complete THEN it SHALL provide execution metrics and timing data
3. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL capture detailed error context and agent states
4. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parallel processing capabilities, so that independent tasks can execute concurrently for better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple scenes need processing THEN the system SHALL execute them in parallel
2. WHEN RAG queries can be batched THEN they SHALL be processed concurrently
3. WHEN rendering multiple videos THEN it SHALL utilize available system resources efficiently
4. IF dependencies exist between tasks THEN the system SHALL respect execution order

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want modular agent design, so that individual agents can be updated, tested, and deployed independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is modified THEN it SHALL not affect other agents' functionality
2. WHEN new agents are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing workflows
3. WHEN agents are tested THEN they SHALL be testable in isolation
4. IF agent interfaces change THEN the system SHALL provide backward compatibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to support additional tools and services, so that agents can leverage external capabilities for enhanced functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need document processing THEN they SHALL access document processing tools
2. WHEN enhanced RAG capabilities are needed THEN agents SHALL utilize advanced RAG tools
3. WHEN external services are required THEN agents SHALL connect through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
4. WHEN Context7 integration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide Context7 connectivity for agents

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want human-in-the-loop capabilities, so that I can intervene, review, and guide the agent workflow when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical decisions are needed THEN the system SHALL pause and request human input
2. WHEN agents produce intermediate results THEN users SHALL be able to review and approve them
3. WHEN errors require human judgment THEN the system SHALL escalate to human operators
4. IF users want to modify agent outputs THEN the system SHALL incorporate human feedback into the workflow
