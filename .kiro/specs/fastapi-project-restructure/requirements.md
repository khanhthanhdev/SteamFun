# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up unused files and reorganizing the current project structure to support FastAPI backend development while maintaining existing functionality. The project currently contains multiple components including video generation, RAG systems, AWS integration, and LangGraph agents that need to be properly organized for scalability and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused files and directories removed from the project, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused Python cache files, temporary files, and redundant directories
2. WHEN cleaning up files THEN the system SHALL preserve all essential functionality and configuration files
3. WHEN removing files THEN the system SHALL maintain all active development specs and documentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure reorganized for FastAPI development, so that I can easily scale and maintain the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restructuring the project THEN the system SHALL create a FastAPI-compatible directory structure with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN organizing modules THEN the system SHALL group related functionality into logical packages (api, services, models, etc.)
3. WHEN restructuring THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing import statements where possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want core business logic separated from framework-specific code, so that the application is more testable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate business logic from API endpoints and framework code
2. WHEN structuring services THEN the system SHALL implement clear interfaces between different layers
3. WHEN organizing models THEN the system SHALL create dedicated directories for data models, schemas, and database entities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration and environment management centralized, so that deployment and environment setup is simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing configuration THEN the system SHALL consolidate all configuration files into a dedicated config directory
2. WHEN managing environments THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between development, testing, and production configurations
3. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL implement secure configuration management practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing infrastructure properly organized, so that I can easily run and maintain tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL structure tests to mirror the application structure
2. WHEN setting up testing THEN the system SHALL provide clear separation between unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
3. WHEN configuring tests THEN the system SHALL ensure all test utilities and fixtures are properly organized
