# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating AWS S3 storage capabilities with existing LangGraph agents for an AI-powered video editing system. The system will enable local AI agents to generate Manim code and render videos locally, while leveraging AWS S3 for scalable storage, DynamoDB for metadata management, and CloudFront for global content delivery. This integration maintains the existing local agent processing capabilities while adding robust cloud storage and streaming infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AWS S3 Video Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a video creator, I want my generated videos to be automatically stored in AWS S3 so that I can access them from anywhere and stream them efficiently to viewers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video is successfully rendered by the RendererAgent THEN the system SHALL upload video chunks to S3 with organized naming conventions (project_id/video_id/chunk_id.mp4)
2. WHEN all video chunks are rendered THEN the system SHALL upload the combined full video to S3 with versioning support
3. WHEN uploading videos to S3 THEN the system SHALL use appropriate storage classes (S3 Standard for active videos, S3 Intelligent-Tiering for variable access patterns)
4. WHEN storing videos in S3 THEN the system SHALL enable server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
5. WHEN video upload fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
6. WHEN videos are stored THEN the system SHALL implement S3 lifecycle policies for cost optimization

### Requirement 2: AWS S3 Code Storage Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Manim code generated by my agents to be stored in AWS S3 with version control so that I can track changes and revert to previous versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CodeGeneratorAgent generates Manim code THEN the system SHALL upload the code to S3 Code Bucket with clear naming conventions (code/project_id/video_id/video_id_v1.py)
2. WHEN code is modified during editing THEN the system SHALL create new versions in S3 (video_id_v2.py, video_id_v3.py)
3. WHEN storing code in S3 THEN the system SHALL implement strict access controls using IAM policies
4. WHEN code upload fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and error handling
5. WHEN code is stored THEN the system SHALL enable S3 versioning for rollback capabilities
6. WHEN code contains sensitive information THEN the system SHALL use S3 Object Lock for critical versions

### Requirement 3: DynamoDB Metadata Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want video and code metadata to be stored in DynamoDB so that I can efficiently query and manage the relationships between videos and their source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video project is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique UUID and store metadata in DynamoDB
2. WHEN video or code is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL update DynamoDB with S3 paths and version information
3. WHEN querying metadata THEN the system SHALL support fast lookups by video_id, project_id, and version_id
4. WHEN metadata is updated THEN the system SHALL track creation_timestamp, last_edited_timestamp, and status fields
5. WHEN storing metadata THEN the system SHALL include video title, description, tags, and chunk information
6. WHEN metadata operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and consistency checks

### Requirement 4: LangGraph Agent AWS Integration

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to seamlessly integrate with AWS services so that I can upload generated content and retrieve existing assets without disrupting the local processing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RendererAgent completes video rendering THEN it SHALL automatically upload results to S3 and update DynamoDB metadata
2. WHEN CodeGeneratorAgent generates code THEN it SHALL upload the code to S3 and link it to video metadata
3. WHEN agents need existing content THEN they SHALL download from S3 using metadata from DynamoDB
4. WHEN AWS operations are performed THEN agents SHALL use boto3 SDK with proper authentication and error handling
5. WHEN AWS services are unavailable THEN agents SHALL gracefully degrade to local-only operation
6. WHEN uploading large files THEN agents SHALL implement multipart upload for efficiency

### Requirement 5: CloudFront Content Delivery Integration

**User Story:** As a video viewer, I want videos to load quickly from anywhere in the world so that I can have a smooth streaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN videos are uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL configure CloudFront distribution for global delivery
2. WHEN users request videos THEN CloudFront SHALL serve content from the nearest edge location
3. WHEN videos are updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate CloudFront cache appropriately
4. WHEN serving videos THEN CloudFront SHALL support adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS/DASH)
5. WHEN configuring CloudFront THEN the system SHALL implement proper security headers and access controls
6. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track CloudFront metrics and cache hit rates

### Requirement 6: Video Transcoding and Optimization

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want my videos to be automatically transcoded into multiple formats and qualities so that viewers can have the best experience on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a full video is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL trigger AWS Elemental MediaConvert for transcoding
2. WHEN transcoding THEN the system SHALL generate multiple quality levels (1080p, 720p, 480p)
3. WHEN transcoding THEN the system SHALL create adaptive bitrate streaming formats (HLS, DASH)
4. WHEN transcoding completes THEN the system SHALL update DynamoDB with transcoded file paths
5. WHEN transcoding fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and error notifications
6. WHEN serving transcoded content THEN the system SHALL use CloudFront for optimal delivery

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want robust error handling for AWS operations so that temporary failures don't disrupt the video generation workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN S3 uploads fail THEN the system SHALL retry with different strategies (multipart, reduced concurrency)
3. WHEN DynamoDB operations fail THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency and retry appropriately
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue operations for later execution
5. WHEN AWS service limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and graceful degradation
6. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information and notify administrators

### Requirement 8: Security and Access Control

1. WHEN configuring AWS access THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
2. WHEN storing data in S3 THEN the system SHALL enable encryption at rest and in transit

4. WHEN handling sensitive code THEN the system SHALL implement additional encryption and access logging
5. WHEN users access content THEN the system SHALL implement proper authorization checks
6. WHEN monitoring access THEN the system SHALL log all AWS operations for audit purposes

### Requirement 9: Cost Optimization and Monitoring

4. WHEN CloudFront usage is high THEN the system SHALL optimize caching strategies to reduce origin requests
5. WHEN DynamoDB usage grows THEN the system SHALL implement efficient query patterns and indexing
6. WHEN costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL send alerts and suggest optimization strategies

### Requirement 10: Local-Cloud Synchronization

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working offline THEN agents SHALL continue to function with local storage only
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync local changes to AWS
3. WHEN conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL implement conflict resolution strategies (latest wins, manual resolution)
