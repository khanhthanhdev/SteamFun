# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the existing video generation agents to follow LangGraph best practices. The current agent system has complex inheritance patterns, mixed responsibilities, and lacks proper error handling, monitoring, and state management that align with LangGraph's recommended patterns. The refactor will simplify the architecture, improve reliability, and make the system more maintainable while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent system to follow LangGraph best practices for graph design and architecture, so that the codebase is more maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent system is refactored THEN each agent SHALL be implemented as simple, focused node functions rather than complex class hierarchies
2. WHEN agents are defined THEN they SHALL have descriptive, action-oriented names that clearly indicate their purpose
3. WHEN the state schema is defined THEN it SHALL use Pydantic models for comprehensive type safety and validation
4. WHEN the graph structure is designed THEN it SHALL start simple and avoid unnecessary complexity
5. WHEN agents interact THEN they SHALL follow single responsibility principle with clear boundaries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want improved control flow and routing mechanisms, so that the workflow can handle dynamic conditions and failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN routing between agents THEN the system SHALL use conditional edges based on state conditions rather than complex routing logic
2. WHEN external API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN maximum iterations are reached THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breakers with proper timeouts
4. WHEN routing decisions are made THEN they SHALL be based on clear state conditions and be easily testable
5. WHEN workflow execution encounters errors THEN routing SHALL handle error states appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring, so that I can debug issues effectively and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent executes THEN it SHALL wrap operations in comprehensive try-catch blocks with specific error types
2. WHEN agents process data THEN they SHALL implement detailed logging at each step for debugging and performance tracking
3. WHEN long-running workflows execute THEN they SHALL use checkpointing to enable recovery from failures
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized and handled with appropriate recovery strategies
5. WHEN system health is monitored THEN metrics SHALL be collected and made available for analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the agent system to be optimized for efficiency, so that video generation completes quickly and uses resources effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state objects are managed THEN they SHALL contain only necessary information to keep memory usage lean
2. WHEN expensive operations are performed THEN they SHALL implement caching mechanisms for API calls and computations
3. WHEN independent operations exist THEN they SHALL use parallel execution where possible
4. WHEN resources are allocated THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up after use
5. WHEN performance bottlenecks are identified THEN they SHALL be addressed through optimization strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and validation capabilities, so that I can ensure the refactored system works correctly and maintains backward compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN individual agent functions are developed THEN they SHALL be unit tested independently
2. WHEN the complete workflow is assembled THEN it SHALL undergo integration testing with realistic data
3. WHEN state transitions occur THEN they SHALL be validated to ensure data integrity
4. WHEN the refactored system is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces
5. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL cover both success and failure scenarios

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want the system to follow security and production best practices, so that the application is safe to deploy and operate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inputs are processed THEN they SHALL be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks
2. WHEN external connections are made THEN they SHALL implement proper resource cleanup
3. WHEN configuration is managed THEN it SHALL use environment variables instead of hardcoded values
4. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN it SHALL follow secure coding practices
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include proper security headers and validation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved development workflow and tooling, so that I can work efficiently with the refactored agent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the graph THEN developers SHALL have access to visualization tools for debugging
2. WHEN creating agent functions THEN they SHALL be reusable and modular
3. WHEN state schema changes are made THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN developers SHALL have clear visibility into graph execution flow
5. WHEN extending the system THEN new agents SHALL follow established patterns and conventions
