# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a comprehensive local testing infrastructure that enables developers to run and validate both the testing agents system and FastAPI backend in a step-by-step manner. The system will include automated test suites, manual testing workflows, integration testing capabilities, and clear documentation for developers to verify system functionality locally before deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run comprehensive local tests for the testing agents system, so that I can verify all agent functionality works correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the local testing suite THEN the system SHALL execute all unit tests for individual agents
2. WHEN a developer runs integration tests THEN the system SHALL validate agent interactions and workflow execution
3. WHEN a developer runs performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure agent response times and resource usage
4. IF any agent test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and debugging information
5. WHEN all agent tests pass THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive test report

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run comprehensive local tests for the FastAPI backend, so that I can ensure all API endpoints and services function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs API tests THEN the system SHALL validate all REST endpoints with various input scenarios
2. WHEN a developer runs database tests THEN the system SHALL verify data persistence and retrieval operations
3. WHEN a developer runs authentication tests THEN the system SHALL validate security mechanisms and access controls
4. IF any API test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed HTTP response information and stack traces
5. WHEN all API tests pass THEN the system SHALL confirm backend readiness for integration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run end-to-end integration tests locally, so that I can verify the complete system works together seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs integration tests THEN the system SHALL test complete workflows from API requests through agent processing
2. WHEN integration tests execute THEN the system SHALL validate data flow between FastAPI backend and testing agents
3. WHEN testing real scenarios THEN the system SHALL simulate actual user interactions and validate expected outcomes
4. IF integration tests fail THEN the system SHALL identify which component or interface caused the failure
5. WHEN integration tests pass THEN the system SHALL confirm system-wide functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want step-by-step testing workflows with clear documentation, so that I can systematically validate each component and understand the testing process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses testing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear step-by-step instructions for each testing phase
2. WHEN following testing workflows THEN the system SHALL include commands, expected outputs, and troubleshooting guidance
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and intermediate validation checkpoints
4. IF a testing step fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps and common solutions
5. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all validation results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test environment setup and teardown, so that I can run tests in isolated, reproducible environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer initiates testing THEN the system SHALL automatically set up required test databases and services
2. WHEN tests require specific configurations THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate test settings and environment variables
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up test data and reset environment state
4. IF environment setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and setup verification steps
5. WHEN using Docker THEN the system SHALL provide containerized testing environments for consistency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and load testing capabilities, so that I can validate system behavior under various load conditions locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs load tests THEN the system SHALL simulate multiple concurrent requests and agent operations
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL track response times, throughput, and resource utilization
3. WHEN load testing agents THEN the system SHALL validate agent stability and error handling under stress
4. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL flag potential bottlenecks and performance issues
5. WHEN load tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports with recommendations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test each individual agent and capture their outputs, so that I can verify each agent's specific functionality and debug issues at the component level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs individual agent tests THEN the system SHALL execute each agent in isolation and capture all outputs
2. WHEN testing specific agents THEN the system SHALL provide input scenarios tailored to each agent's functionality
3. WHEN agents produce outputs THEN the system SHALL validate output format, content, and expected behavior
4. IF an agent fails THEN the system SHALL capture detailed logs, error messages, and intermediate processing states
5. WHEN agent testing completes THEN the system SHALL provide agent-specific reports with output samples and performance metrics

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test AWS cloud integrations including video and code uploads, so that I can verify cloud functionality works correctly from the local environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing AWS integrations THEN the system SHALL validate S3 upload functionality for both video and code files
2. WHEN uploading test videos THEN the system SHALL verify MediaConvert transcoding and CloudFront distribution
3. WHEN uploading test code THEN the system SHALL validate code storage, retrieval, and processing workflows
4. IF AWS operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed AWS error responses and troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN cloud tests pass THEN the system SHALL confirm end-to-end cloud integration functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test data management, so that I can run tests with realistic data scenarios and maintain test data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require data THEN the system SHALL provide test data fixtures and factories for various scenarios
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL ensure test data isolation and prevent data contamination between tests
3. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL include boundary value testing and error condition data
4. IF test data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect and restore clean test data automatically
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL preserve test results while cleaning transient test data
