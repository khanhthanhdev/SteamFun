# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a comprehensive testing interface for LangGraph agents using a Gradio frontend and FastAPI backend. The system enables step-by-step testing of individual agents with real-time logging and monitoring capabilities. Users can input test data through the UI, execute agent workflows, and observe detailed backend logs to understand agent behavior and troubleshoot issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a web-based testing interface, so that I can easily test LangGraph agents without writing custom test scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL provide a Gradio web interface accessible via browser
2. WHEN a user accesses the interface THEN the system SHALL display available agents for testing
3. WHEN a user selects an agent THEN the system SHALL show relevant input fields for that agent
4. IF the interface is running THEN it SHALL be responsive and user-friendly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test individual agents in isolation, so that I can debug specific agent behaviors without interference from other components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an agent THEN the system SHALL display that agent's specific input requirements
2. WHEN a user clicks "Run" THEN the system SHALL execute only the selected agent with provided inputs
3. WHEN an agent executes THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and intermediate outputs
4. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL display the agent's specific results and any errors
5. IF multiple agents are available THEN each SHALL be testable independently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time backend logs, so that I can monitor agent execution and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent starts execution THEN the backend SHALL generate detailed logs
2. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL be visible in real-time in the UI
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL highlight error logs prominently
4. WHEN execution completes THEN all logs SHALL remain accessible for review
5. IF multiple agents run simultaneously THEN logs SHALL be properly separated and labeled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a FastAPI backend to handle agent execution, so that I have a robust and scalable testing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize a FastAPI backend server
2. WHEN the UI sends requests THEN the backend SHALL process them asynchronously
3. WHEN agents execute THEN the backend SHALL manage their lifecycle and state
4. WHEN multiple requests arrive THEN the backend SHALL handle them concurrently
5. IF an agent fails THEN the backend SHALL capture and return detailed error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear setup instructions, so that I can quickly get the testing environment running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include step-by-step setup instructions
2. WHEN following the setup guide THEN a developer SHALL be able to start both backend and frontend
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify all dependencies are properly installed
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN clear examples SHALL be provided
5. IF setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input custom test data, so that I can test agents with various scenarios and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is selected THEN the UI SHALL display appropriate input fields
2. WHEN a user enters test data THEN the system SHALL validate the input format
3. WHEN invalid data is entered THEN the system SHALL show clear validation errors
4. WHEN valid data is submitted THEN it SHALL be passed to the selected agent
5. IF an agent requires specific input formats THEN the UI SHALL provide input helpers or examples

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the complete workflow from input to video output, so that I can validate the entire system end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Full Workflow" THEN the system SHALL execute all agents in sequence
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL show progress through each agent step
3. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the system SHALL produce a complete video output
4. WHEN video generation finishes THEN the system SHALL provide download or preview options
5. IF the workflow fails at any step THEN the system SHALL show exactly where and why it failed

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to save and load test configurations, so that I can reuse common test scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test configuration is created THEN the user SHALL be able to save it with a name
2. WHEN saved configurations exist THEN they SHALL be available for loading
3. WHEN a configuration is loaded THEN all input fields SHALL be populated automatically
4. WHEN configurations are managed THEN users SHALL be able to delete or modify them
5. IF configurations become invalid THEN the system SHALL notify users and suggest fixes
