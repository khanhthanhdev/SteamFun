# Task 5 Completion Summary: Multipart Upload Handler

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive MultipartUploadHandler class that provides advanced multipart upload functionality with resume capability, integrity verification, upload abortion, and cleanup for failed transfers using boto3 TransferConfig.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. MultipartUploadHandler Class
- **Location**: `src/aws/multipart_upload_handler.py`
- **Purpose**: Main handler for large file uploads with multipart support
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic multipart detection based on file size threshold
  - Resume functionality for interrupted uploads
  - Integrity verification using ETag comparison
  - Upload abortion and cleanup for failed transfers
  - Concurrent part uploads with semaphore control
  - Exponential backoff retry logic

#### 2. Supporting Classes

##### MultipartUploadInfo
- Tracks upload state and progress
- Calculates progress percentage
- Manages upload parts and metadata

##### UploadPart
- Represents individual parts in multipart upload
- Stores part number, ETag, size, and upload timestamp

##### MultipartProgressTracker
- Thread-safe progress tracking
- Real-time upload statistics
- Custom callback support for progress updates

### Key Functionality

#### 1. Large File Upload with Automatic Multipart Detection
```python
async def upload_large_file(self, file_path: str, bucket: str, key: str,
                           extra_args: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
                           progress_callback: Optional[Callable] = None) -> str
```
- Automatically detects if file qualifies for multipart upload
- Uses standard upload for smaller files
- Implements multipart upload for large files

#### 2. Upload Resume Functionality
```python
async def _find_existing_upload(self, bucket: str, key: str, 
                               expected_size: int) -> Optional[MultipartUploadInfo]
```
- Finds existing incomplete multipart uploads
- Verifies integrity of existing parts
- Resumes upload from where it left off

#### 3. Upload Integrity Verification
```python
async def _verify_upload_integrity(self, upload_info: MultipartUploadInfo, 
                                  final_etag: Optional[str]) -> bool
```
- Verifies completed upload using ETag comparison
- Checks object size matches expected size
- Provides integrity assurance

#### 4. Upload Abortion and Cleanup
```python
async def _abort_multipart_upload(self, upload_info: MultipartUploadInfo)
async def cleanup_abandoned_uploads(self, bucket: str, max_age_hours: int = 24) -> int
```
- Aborts failed multipart uploads
- Cleans up abandoned uploads older than specified age
- Prevents storage cost accumulation from incomplete uploads

### Configuration Integration

The handler integrates with the existing AWSConfig system:
- `multipart_threshold`: File size threshold for multipart uploads (default: 100MB)
- `chunk_size`: Size of each upload part (default: 8MB)
- `max_concurrent_uploads`: Maximum concurrent part uploads (default: 3)
- `max_retries`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
- `retry_backoff_base`: Base for exponential backoff (default: 2)

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling includes:
- **Retryable Errors**: Network timeouts, service unavailable, throttling
- **Non-Retryable Errors**: Access denied, invalid bucket, malformed requests
- **Exponential Backoff**: Prevents overwhelming AWS services during retries
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation when possible

### Testing

#### Unit Tests
- **Location**: `src/aws/test_multipart_upload_handler.py`
- **Coverage**: 16 test cases covering all major functionality
- **Results**: All tests passing

#### Verification Script
- **Location**: `src/aws/verify_multipart_upload_handler.py`
- **Purpose**: End-to-end functionality verification
- **Results**: All verification tests passed

#### Example Usage
- **Location**: `examples/multipart_upload_usage.py`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates practical usage patterns
- **Features**: Progress tracking, error handling, resume functionality

## Requirements Satisfaction

### ✅ Requirement 4.4: Multipart Upload for Efficiency
- **Implementation**: Automatic multipart detection and upload
- **Verification**: Files above threshold use multipart upload
- **Benefits**: Improved upload speed and reliability for large files

### ✅ Requirement 1.5: Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive retry logic in `_upload_with_retry` and `_upload_single_part`
- **Features**: Exponential backoff with jitter, configurable retry limits
- **Error Types**: Handles both retryable and non-retryable errors

### ✅ Requirement 7.1: AWS API Failure Handling
- **Implementation**: Robust error handling throughout the handler
- **Features**: Detailed error logging, graceful degradation, cleanup on failure
- **Integration**: Works with existing AWS exception hierarchy

## Integration Points

### 1. AWS Configuration System
- Seamlessly integrates with existing `AWSConfig` class
- Uses established configuration patterns
- Supports all existing encryption and security settings

### 2. Credentials Management
- Works with existing `AWSCredentialsManager`
- Supports all authentication methods
- Maintains security best practices

### 3. Logging System
- Integrates with existing AWS logging configuration

- **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time upload status

## Usage Examples

### Basic Large File Upload
```python
handler = MultipartUploadHandler(config, credentials_manager)
s3_url = await handler.upload_large_file(
    file_path="large_video.mp4",
    bucket="my-bucket",
    key="videos/large_video.mp4"
)
```

### Upload with Progress Tracking
```python
def progress_callback(uploaded, total, percentage):
    print(f"Progress: {percentage:.1f}%")

s3_url = await handler.upload_large_file(
    file_path="large_video.mp4",
    bucket="my-bucket", 
    key="videos/large_video.mp4",
    progress_callback=progress_callback
)
```

### Upload Management
```python
# List active uploads
active_uploads = await handler.list_active_uploads()

# Cleanup abandoned uploads
cleanup_count = await handler.cleanup_abandoned_uploads("my-bucket", 24)
```
